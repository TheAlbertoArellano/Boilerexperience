            <h2>Student Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> ⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆ (3/5)</p>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The instructor was knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, often sharing real-world examples that helped make the material more relatable.</li>
                <li>Group projects were a highlight; collaborating with classmates on networking simulations was both challenging and rewarding.</li>
                <li>The course material is relevant, especially if you’re considering a career in IT or related fields.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The grading was vague, which made it tough to gauge how to prioritize assignments and exams.</li>
                <li>Some topics felt rushed. For example, while we touched on cybersecurity fundamentals, I wish we could have gone deeper into that area.</li>
                <li>There were a few technical issues with the online resources that were frustrating at times.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a student who took CNIT 176 this past semester, I found it to be a mixed experience. The course covers a lot of ground in the realm of networking, which I appreciated, but I felt that some areas were a bit vague.
            Overall, CNIT 176 is a decent introduction to networking, but be prepared to seek additional resources if you want to fully grasp some of the concepts!</p>
